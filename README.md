By: Syeda Sania Bokhari

# Project Overview
This project simulates an ecommerce database with realistic tables and data to analyze customer behavior, marketing campaign effectiveness, and sales performance using SQL. It showcases practical queries that a business or data analyst would use to generate actionable insights.

# Database Structure
- customers: Customer info including signup date and marketing channel
- campaigns: Marketing campaigns linked to channels with budgets
- events: Customer webpage interactions with timestamps
- carts: Cart creation records including items added
- orders: Customer orders linked to carts with amount and timestamp
  
# Key Business Questions Addressed
- How many customers signed up from each marketing channel?
- How many times was each page type visited per day?
- What percentage of customers added items to their cart but didnâ€™t place an order?
- Which marketing channel generated the highest number of orders and revenue?
- How long does it take customers to place an order after signing up?
- What is the average cart size and corresponding order value per customer?
- How does order volume and revenue trend over time?
- How many users drop off at each stage of the purchase funnel?
- Which marketing channel has the highest average order value?
- Who are the most valuable customers by total revenue and order count?
